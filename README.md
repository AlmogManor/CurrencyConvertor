How to install:
While I am waiting for this extension to be approved by microsoft, you can install it as a developer build the following way:

1. download the code from this repository
2. unzip the folder, you should have a folder named "CurrencyConvertor", with folders named "popup" and "icons" inside.
3. save this folder somewhere safe, I recommend "C:\Program Files", if you delete this file the extension will be deleted too.
4. follow the next steps depending on your browser:

Google Chrome:
5.1. open the settings page
5.2. open the Extensions page (chrome://extensions/)
5.3. on the top left, enable Developer Mode
5.4. click Load unpacked
5.5. select the CurrencyConvertor folder you saved in step 2

Microsoft Edge:
5.1. open the Extensions page (edge://extensions/)
5.2. on the bottom left, enable Developer Mode
5.3. click Load unpacked
5.4. select the CurrencyConvertor folder you saved in step 2
